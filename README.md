# Jekyll PostCSS v2
A revamp of [jekyll-postcss](https://github.com/mhanberg/jekyll-postcss) that uses Jekyll hooks and generally tries to be less complicated.

## Installation

_`Gemfile`_
```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-postcss-v2'
end
```

_`_config.yml`  
<sup>(Until [jekyll#8585](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/8585) is released)</sup>_ 
```yml
plugins:
  - jekyll-postcss-v2
```

_In your jekyll source directory:_
```bash
npm i -D postcss postcss-cli
```

Also install any postcss plugins you wish to use. For example, [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), [cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) etc.

## Usage

Configure your `postcss.config.js` file in your jekyll source directory.

## Deployment

Please note that this plugin isn't supported by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which means by default you are not able to use it, when you are hosting your site at GitHub Pages.

However, there's the option to perform the build process via GitHub Actions.

To do that, you need to create a yml-workflow-file inside .github/workflows of your repository that represents your build process. This could look like the following:

```yml
name: Jekyll Deploy

on:
  schedule:
    # run daily at 05:30
    - cron:  '30 5 * * *'
  push:
    branches:
      - master
    paths-ignore:
      - 'Gemfile'
      - 'README.md'
      - 'LICENSE.md'
 
# Build site using jekyll
jobs:
  jekyll:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # checkout code
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Use ruby/setup-ruby to shorten build times
      # https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby
      - uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: 2.7 # Not needed with a .ruby-version file
          bundler-cache: true # runs 'bundle install' and caches installed gems automatically
      # Install Node as this is needed for PurgeCSS
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      # Install PostCSS plugins (from your package.json)
      - run: npm install
      # - run: npm test ( this fails with exit code 1 - see package.json
      - name: Build site
      # use jekyll-action-ts to build
      # https://github.com/limjh16/jekyll-action-ts
        uses: limjh16/jekyll-action-ts@v2
        with:
          enable_cache: true
          # custom_opts: '--verbose --trace'  #'--drafts --future'
          ### If you need to specify any Jekyll build options, enable the above input
          ### Flags accepted can be found here https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/#build-command-options
      # use actions-gh-pages to deploy
      # https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages
      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          # GITHUB_TOKEN secret is set up automatically
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./_site
```

## Why v2?
- Better logging to help catch when things aren't running
- Processes the output file on disk, skipping the need to parse Sass
- Doesn't transfer file contents over a network or cli parameter, avoiding issues when files are too large for buffers
- Respects the Jekyll source directory for configuration files
- Fewer moving parts. No sockets, no bundled node scripts, no internal caching
- Probably works with Tailwind JIT<sup>[citation needed]</sup> ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Why not?
- Potentially slower<sup>[citation needed]</sup>, but more than fast enough for my needs. 

## TODO
- Write tests
- Wire up a CI
- Add configuration
  - _postcss.config.js location_
  - _node_modules location_
- Profile in production / development
- Investigate what needs to be done around the sourcemap
- More logging.
  - Before/after filesizes
  - Timings
